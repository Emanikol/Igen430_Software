# PIC Testing Platform Software

This is the motor control code specifically made for our engineering Capstone project. The project is a photonic integrated circuit testing platform that uses mechanical flexures and stepper motors to operate precisely, moving in 0.5 Î¼m steps in both the X and Y axes. 

This code makes the motors spin after inputting coordinates. It can control the microstepping of the motors, the speed of the motors, and also implements safety precautions that stop the motors when they reach a certain threshold.
